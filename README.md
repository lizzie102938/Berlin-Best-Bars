Kayak single page application using React.

Data:

I couldn't manage to fetch data from the API they gave me, so I decided to just
manually input it. I don't know if they expected me to fetch it from the API or
if the manual approach is ok. They confirmed with me I only needed to include the
12 cards shown, so decided doing it manually was better than nothing.

I initially created the data in ./components/CardCollection.js. I have also now
copied the same data into Data.js. I probably don't need it in two places, but
it was just part of me playing around with getting the filter implemented.

Filter:

I have created the checkboxes I need for the filter functionality, but cannot
get my head around how to connect the data. I have tried a few different approaches
but keep getting stuck.

Tests:

Do you think they'll expect me to add a couple of tests? I plan on adding at least
a couple, but haven't done testing in React before so will have to work it out.

Styling:

Mostly done now, just need to work out how to add 10px between the checkbox and
label. Tried a few things, but didn't work. Not to worried if I can't work this
out though!

File organisation:

I have included component.js files and their respective css files in the
"components" folder. Should I put the css files elsewhere?
